# Levelup

## Introduction

This is LevelUp, a collab project completed by students at the [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/) currently in the Fourth Cohort in November 2015. 

## Installation

* This is a Rails Project. Simply clone the repo and `bundle install` from the terminal and you should be set up to run this on your local computer.
* Git: `git clone git@github.com:loganmeetsworld/LevelUp.git`

## Concept 

This project was created in order to share resources while learning how to code. We hope that this project will help other students in our school as well as students outside of our school to reach resources that are actually helpfull at different phases in the learning process. These are resources which we found helpful while we are learning. 

## Technologies

* Ruby on Rails 2.2.3
* Devise Gem for Authentification
* OAuth for a GitHub login
* HTML5/CSS3
* Skeleton CSS3 Framework

## Features

* Ability to login and edit your account information, ability to track your account progress through all the links 
* Ability to add, edit, and create resources
* Ability to see the resources without becomming a member of the website
* Responsive Design

## Improvements for the Future

* Authentification through more than just GitHub (like Twitter, Facebook, and Google)
* Mobile first development for easy of use on your device
* Javascript for a more fluid front-end

## Contributing to development

Code reviews would be fantastic for this project. I am a 3 month old developer at the launch of this project and really love all the feedback I can get. I also will trying to maintain and update the project for future use and add better front-end components as I learn them. If you see an area for improvement on this project, a PR is more than welcome as well.
